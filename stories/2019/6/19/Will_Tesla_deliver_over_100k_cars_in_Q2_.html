We believe we    will deliver between    90,000 and 100,000 vehicles in Q2. Although it is possible to deliver a higher number of vehicles, we believe it is    important to begin    unwinding the &quot;wave&quot; approach to vehicle deliveries, where overseas cars have been made in the first half of the    quarter and North    American cars have been made in the second half. This puts extreme stress on Tesla, negatively affects our working    capital needs and    adds to our cost structure. </blockquote>  In  addition Elon has stated in both the Q1 conference call and in leaked emails they can hit and exceed that target. At  the shareholders conference Elon went a step further and stated the EV company could produce a record quarter on every  level.</p><p class="story-para flow-text"><h5>Crowd sourcing</h5>  There are few better estimators than <a href="https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike" target="_blank">Troy Teslike    @TroyTeslike</a> , he&apos;s a  Tesla Motors Forum user who  setup a spreadsheet to track various metrics from real Tesla customers. His estimates have been pretty accurate and  his last tweet suggested around 85,187 cars delivered.  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My Tesla delivery estimate for Q2 2019 is now 85,187 units. I will update this on 30 June      2019. The increase compared to my previous estimate is mostly because of Canada sales. <a href="https://t.co/m6EDb7i0vv">pic.twitter.com/m6EDb7i0vv</a></p>— Troy Teslike (@TroyTeslike) <a href="https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike/status/1140358809921183744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2019</a></blockquote><script async="async" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p class="story-para flow-text">  One of the original crowd sourced estimators was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/tesla-model-3-vin-tracker/">Bloomberg&apos;s Model 3 tracker</a>  which has been retired. However it was showing Tesla moving towards 850 Model 3&apos;s a  day in average. The original author of that, Tom Randall, has since moved it to track other  data-sets.</p><p class="story-para flow-text"><img src="/images/stories/Bloomberg-Tracker.PNG"/><blockquote>Now it’s time to move on to tracking the next phase in Tesla’s evolution. As the company proved its    ability to crank out Model 3s, investors have turned to different metrics of success. Tesla shares have been in a    tailspin in recent weeks on doubts about consumer demand for the Model 3—and electric vehicles writ large. Tesla    needs to prove it can mass produce cars with the quality, reliability, innovation and service to keep attracting new    customers as traditional automakers add more electric options.  </blockquote></p><p class="story-para flow-text"><h5>Bulls</h5>  One of the most vocals bulls is <a href="https://twitter.com/Gfilche"> Gali [@Gfilche]</a> also knows  as &quot;Let&apos;s go to You Tube&quot; guy, affects  Elon Musk took his question on the Q1 2018 Conference call (After hanging up on a few Wall Street Analysts).  The HyperChange CEO post his high energy and informative videos on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1LAjODfg7dnSSrrPGGPPMw">You Tube channel</a></p><p class="story-para flow-text">  On this video predicts over 90k deliveries for Q2 based on various pieces of evidence.  <style>    .embed-container {      position: relative;      padding-bottom: 56.25%;      height: 0;      overflow: hidden;      max-width: 100%;    }    .embed-container iframe,    .embed-container object,    .embed-container embed {      position: absolute;      top: 0;      left: 0;      width: 100%;      height: 100%;    }  </style><div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZTrf5RY1so" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></p><p class="story-para flow-text"><h5>Bear a.k.a. Business Insider</h5>  If you follow Tesla in the media you will quickly become aware that there  are some media outlets that only publish the most negative articles about the  company. Though there are many, the King of these are Business Insider, if you  do some research you will understand why.</p><p class="story-para flow-text">  Their latest hit piece suggests Tesla is missing it targets based on a leaked document  (Which is nowhere to be seen). But boils down to talking about a particular segment  of the production line which hasn&apos;t hit the 1000 a day target for Model 3 production.</p><p class="story-para flow-text"><img src="/images/stories/bi.PNG"/></p><p class="story-para flow-text">The article presents no evidence and talks in vague terms using the work segment without  explaining it. This is par for the course for Business Insider so a ton of sodium should  be nearby when reading it.</p><p class="story-para flow-text"><h5>So....?</h5>  Ultimately no one knows the actual numbers except Tesla and with 11 days of the quarter left  triple digit deliveries are within reach if Tesla pushes hard next week.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div>
